# Menu API Demo

Considering the need for scalability and efficient search functionality, Menu API uses `ElasticSearch` as the data store and `FastAPI/uvicorn` as the API server. By implementing this design, the application can leverage the robust searching capabilities of `Elasticsearch` while simultaneously benefiting from the high-performance and developer-friendly experience offered by `FastAPI`. This combination ensures efficient search functionality and a seamless development process.

## Requirements
The development environment uses the following settings.
* Linux or Windows WSL2
* Git
* Python 3.10
* Docker 23.0.5, 20.10.23
* Docker Compose v2.17.3, v2.19.0
  
## Quick Start

Using `docker compose` is the fastest way to start the application (Make sure ports 8000 and 9200 are not occupied by other processes).

```shell
    $ git clone https://github.com/bochen0909/menu-api-demo.git
    $ cd menu-api-demo
```
All of the subsequent commands are expected to be executed within the `menu-api-demo` folder.

Build the image
```shell
    $ docker build -f dockerfile/Dockerfile -t menuapidemo:latest dockerfile
    $ docker image list menuapidemo
    REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
    menuapidemo   latest    e46ed4b862a8   17 hours ago   1.08GB

```
Start the application
```shell
    $ docker compose up
```

When it shows
```
menu-api-demo-api-1            | INFO:     Started server process [8]
menu-api-demo-api-1            | INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
menu-api-demo-api-1            | INFO:     Application startup complete.
menu-api-demo-api-1            | INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

You can either access [Swagger UI](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) to test the APIs,

or invoke them from the command line. 

For example, finding the top 3 restaurants that serve coffee.

```shell
    $ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/food/coffee?limit=3
    [{"id":"1364","score":2.8030283},{"id":"3677","score":1.9024392},{"id":"6022","score":1.9024392}]
```

Finding the menu URL by id.

```shell
    $ curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/restaurant/1364
    {"id":"1364","name":"REVIVE CLUB & CAFE","city":"CICERO","state":"IL","menu_url":"https://reviveclubandcafe.com/"}
```
Cleanup
```shell
    $ docker compose down  # be sure in project root folder

```
## Manually (step by step)

### Clone the code 
```shell
    $ git clone https://github.com/bochen0909/menu-api-demo.git
    $ cd menu-api-demo
```
All of the subsequent commands are expected to be executed within the `menu-api-demo` folder.

### Build the image
```shell
    $ docker build -f dockerfile/Dockerfile -t menuapidemo:latest dockerfile
    $ docker image list menuapidemo
    REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
    menuapidemo   latest    e46ed4b862a8   17 hours ago   1.08GB

```
### Create a new network
```shell
    $ docker network create menudemo
    $ docker network list  | grep menudemo
    4707dbcee347   menudemo   bridge    local
``` 
### Start Elasticsearch instance
```shell
    $ docker run -p 9200:9200  -e "discovery.type=single-node"  -e "xpack.security.enabled=false"  -it --rm  --name es01 --net=menudemo  docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.8.1
    $ docker container list -f name=es01
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                                 COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                              NAMES
9de65331d4e1   docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.8.1   "/bin/tini -- /usr/lâ€¦"   6 minutes ago   Up 6 minutes   0.0.0.0:9200->9200/tcp, 9300/tcp   es01
```
In this demo, security measures such as username and password authentication and HTTP client authentication are disabled for the sake of simplicity. However, please note that this approach is not suitable for a production environment.

### Populate sample data
```shell
    $ docker run -v `pwd`/data/restaurants:/data --network menudemo -it --rm  menuapidemo load_data_elasticsearch.py /data
    2023-06-28 14:41:22,759 [INFO] Loading 20 files from '/data'.
    2023-06-28 14:41:23,104 [INFO] HEAD http://es01:9200/ [status:200 duration:0.042s]
    2023-06-28 14:41:23,410 [INFO] PUT http://es01:9200/_bulk [status:200 duration:0.305s]
```
All json files are loaded from `data/restaurants` folder to elastic search instance.

### Start the API instance
```shell
    $ docker run  -p 8000:8000 --network menudemo --name api   -it --rm  menuapidemo
    INFO:     Started server process [7]
    INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
    INFO:     Application startup complete.
    INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Now the whole application is up. For examples on how to call the APIs, please refer to [Quick Start](#quick-start) 

### Cleanup

```shell
    $ docker stop container api
    $ docker stop container es01
    $ docker network remove menudemo
```

## Design

When developing a demonstration application, there are several options to consider:

- Load data in memory.
- Load data into a database.
- Single Node vs Multi Nodes.
- ...

For enhanced scalability and large-scale deployments, it is advisable to decouple the data storage from the API services. This separation enables improved management and provides flexibility when scaling the application.

The application's API requires text data searching capabilities. While traditional databases can handle text matching, utilizing tools like Lucene or Elasticsearch offers greater versatility and robustness in terms of search functions.

Considering the need for scalability and efficient search functionality, the optimal design decision is to employ FastAPI for API development and utilize Elasticsearch as the data store.


## Development

### Clone the code 
```shell
    $ git clone https://github.com/bochen0909/menu-api-demo.git
    $ cd menu-api-demo
```
All of the following commands are expected to be executed within the `menu-api-demo` folder.

### Create a Virtual Environment
```shell
    $ python -m venv .venv
    $ source .venv/bin/activate
```
Alternatively, you can use `conda` to create a virtual environment.

### Install required libs
```shell
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start an Elasticsearch instance (might take a bit time)
```shell
    $ docker run -p 9200:9200  -e "discovery.type=single-node"  -e "xpack.security.enabled=false"  -it --rm  --name es01 docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.8.1
```
### Populate sample data
```shell
    $ python scripts/load_data_elasticsearch.py data/restaurants/ http://localhost:9200 
```

### Start `uvicorn` instance
```shell
    $ ES_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9200 PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/src uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Now you can proceed to open the project using the IDE of your choice.
